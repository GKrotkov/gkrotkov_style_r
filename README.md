# gkrotkov_style_r

Hello! This is my personalized style guide for R. My style is mostly based on the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html), with small idosyncracies. 

# Variations from Tidyverse Style Guide

Title | Details
------| -------
Tab spacing | I will use 4 spaces as a tab rather than 2 spaces. 
Else positioning | After an if statement, I will put a newline between the end bracket of the if statement and the else
Return() usage | I will end each function with a return() call rather than relying on R's implicit return of the last evaluated statement.
